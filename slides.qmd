# What powers GitHub Actions give us?

-   Running code while we're sleeping!

## Run arbitrary R scripts

::: incremental
-   Scrape data from the internet

-   Run reports with RMarkdown or Quarto

-   Send emails

-   Save results

-   Deploy Shiny Apps.

-   .. And so on! Depends on what are your skills in R.
:::

## Package development

::: incremental
-   Run `devtools::check()`

-   Run tests

-   Build and update documentation and website
:::

# Git and GitHub

## Git

::: incremental
-   Git is a Version Control System (VCS).

-   It is able to store the change history of all files inside a folder, which we call a repository.

-   It becomes important as your work is collaborative.

-   Git is **software** that you can install on your computer.

## GitHub

::: incremental
-   GitHub is a service where you store and share Git repositories.

-   Used by millions of people in open or closed source projects.

-   Useful for collaborating with other programmers on data science projects.

-   There are alternatives such as GitLab and BitBucket.

-   GitHub is a **website** that you can access on the internet.

## Using Git and GitHub in RStudio

-   You can read in the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.html)!

# GitHub Actions

## What is GitHub Actions?

-   It is a service from GitHub

-   Allows us to automate code executions in the cloud.

## Concepts

::: incremental
-   GitHub Actions allows us to create **workflows**.

-   GH workflows are linked to repositories.

-   A **workflow** needs a description of **Events** and **Jobs**.

-   **Events**: describes what triggers the workflow: in what conditions should the workflow run?

-   **Jobs**: what the workflow should do? Imagine that its a brand new computer with no R installed, and we have to do all the setup in this step!

-   Documentation: <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>
:::

## Important!

-   Workflows are stored in `.yaml` files.

-   The `.yaml` files must be in a specific directory: `.github/workflows/workflow-name.yaml`

## Tips

-   In the repository [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/old/examples#readme) there are some examples of GitHub Actions workflows that we can use and adapt.

-   Package `{usethis}` is helpful to use some GHA workflows available in [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/old/examples#readme): `usethis::use_github_action()` function.

-   Start from an existing workflow file, and change what is necessary.

# Let's practice it!

<!-- TODO! Adapt examples from: -->

<!-- https://github.com/curso-r/202203-oficina-dsp/tree/main/oficinas/29-06-2022-automatizacao -->

<!-- -   Quando comeÃ§ar a escrever cÃ³digos em R, fazer no RStudio. -->
