## TL;DR

In this meetup we will talk about GitHub Actions, and I will be presenting some practial examples. If anyone is interested in following along, is important to:

- Have a GitHub account: <https://github.com/>Â  - it's free.

- It would be nice to already know how to use Git and GitHub in RStudio.\


## Configuring Git and GitHub in RStudio

 If you have not used Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE before, I recommend you take some time to prepare your environment!

Here is a check-list you can use:

-   [Install Git on your computer](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

-   [Create a free account on GitHub](https://github.com/)

-   Install package [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/): `install.packages("usethis")`

-   Introduce yourself to Git:
```r
usethis::use_git_config(
  # your name
  user.name = "Captain Marvel",
  # your email used in your GitHub account
  user.email = "awesomecaptain@gmail.com"
)
```    

-   Create a GitHub PAT Token with `usethis::create_github_token()` (is like a password)

-   Store your token with `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

-   Restart your R Session (usually `CTRL + SHIFT + F10` will do the work)

-   Use `usethis::git_sitrep()` to check if your name, email and PAT are configured. The most important thing to look for is: `Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '<discovered>'`.
